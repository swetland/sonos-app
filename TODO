FEATURES:
- some way to get to the queue from anywhere
- current playing view (large album art, time remaining, etc)
- icons and icon cache
- search / filter
- spotify support
- saving playlists
- UI for zone group management
- reorder-items-in-queue
- implement eventing
- use eventing to detect things changing out from under us (other controllers, etc)
- indicator of active playing track in the Queue list
- indicator of tracks that are already in the Queue?

BUGS:
- should be able to drag albums to the add-to-queue dropzone
- fails to SSDP discover if somebody else has the socket open (platform bug?)
- should retry discovery periodically (esp after network change, etc)
- tear down SonosController threads when inactive
- "All Tracks..." should probably not show in A:ARTISTS/$ARTIST A:/ALBUMS etc
- Container should dynamically size the underlying list
- Sonos should callback with total results size up front to enable that

FIXED/IMPLEMENTED:
- remove-from-queue
- actual artwork for transport controls
- back button always leaves you at the top of the list you went back to
- better add-to-queue vs play-now interactions
